Vastu shastra, literally \\\"science of construction\\\" or \\\"architecture\\\" and ascribed to Mamuni Mayan,[356] explores how the laws of nature affect human dwellings;[357] it employs precise geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived cosmic constructs.[358] As applied in Hindu temple architecture, it is influenced by the Shilpa Shastras, a series of foundational texts whose basic mythological form is the Vastu-Purusha mandala, a square that embodied the \\\"absolute\\\".[359] The Taj Mahal, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by orders of Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, has been described in the UNESCO World Heritage List as \\\"the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage\\\".[360] Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture, developed by the British in the late 19th century, drew on Indo-Islamic architecture.[361] The earliest literature in India, composed between 1500 BCE and 1200 CE, was in the Sanskrit language.[362] Major works of Sanskrit literature include the Rigveda (c. 1500 BCE \\u2013 1200 BCE), the epics: Mah\\u0101bh\\u0101rata (c. 400 BCE \\u2013 400 CE) and the Ramayana (c. 300 BCE and later); Abhij\\xF1\\u0101na\\u015B\\u0101kuntalam (The Recognition of \\u015Aakuntal\\u0101, and other dramas of K\\u0101lid\\u0101sa (c. 5th century CE) and Mah\\u0101k\\u0101vya poetry.[363][364][365] In Tamil literature, the Sangam literature (c. 600 BCE \\u2013 300 BCE) consisting of 2,381 poems, composed by 473 poets, is the earliest work.[366][367][368][369] From the 14th to the 18th centuries, India's literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the emergence of devotional poets like Kab\\u012Br, Tuls\\u012Bd\\u0101s, and Guru N\\u0101nak. This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions.[370] In the 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions. In the 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by the works of the Bengali poet and novelist Rabindranath Tagore,[371] who was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature. Performing arts and media Main articles: Music of India, Dance in India, Cinema of India, and Television in India India's National Academy of Performance Arts has recognised eight Indian dance styles to be classical. One such is Kuchipudi shown here. Indian music ranges over various traditions and regional styles. Classical music encompasses two genres and their various folk offshoots: the northern Hindustani and southern Carnatic schools.[372] Regionalised popular forms include filmi and folk music; the syncretic tradition of the bauls is a well-known form of the latter. Indian dance also features diverse folk and classical forms. Among the better-known folk dances are: the bhangra of Punjab, the bihu of Assam, the Jhumair and chhau of Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal, garba and dandiya of Gujarat, ghoomar of Rajasthan, and the lavani of Maharashtra. Eight dance forms, many with narrative forms and mythological elements, have been accorded classical dance status by India's National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama. These are: bharatanatyam of the state of Tamil Nadu, kathak of Uttar Pradesh, kathakali and mohiniyattam of Kerala, kuchipudi of Andhra Pradesh, manipuri of Manipur, odissi of Odisha, and the sattriya of Assam.[373] Theatre in India melds music, dance, and improvised or written dialogue.[374] Often based on Hindu mythology, but also borrowing from medieval romances or social and political events, Indian theatre includes: the bhavai of Gujarat, the jatra of West Bengal, the nautanki and ramlila of North India, tamasha of Maharashtra, burrakatha of Andhra Pradesh, terukkuttu of Tamil Nadu, and the yakshagana of Karnataka.[375] India has a theatre training institute the National School of Drama (NSD) that is situated at New Delhi It is an autonomous organisation under the Ministry of Culture, Government of India.[376] The Indian film industry produces the world's most-watched cinema.[377] Established regional cinematic traditions exist in the Assamese, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia, Tamil, and Telugu languages.[378] The Hindi language film industry (Bollywood) is the largest sector representing 43% of box office revenue, followed by the South Indian Telugu and Tamil film industries which represent 36% combined.[379]\"\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 17,\n        columnNumber: 9\n      }, this)\n    }, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 16,\n      columnNumber: 9\n    }, this)]\n  }, void 0, true, {\n    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n    lineNumber: 13,\n    columnNumber: 9\n  }, this);\n}\n\n_c = Home;\nexport default Home;\n\nvar _c;\n\n$RefreshReg$(_c, \"Home\");","map":{"version":3,"sources":["C:/Projects/travel/travelfront/src/components/Home.js"],"names":["React","Carousel","Aeroplane","Bus","Train","Car","Travel","Home","backgroundImage","backgroundColor","color","textAlign","fontSize","paddingTop","paddingBottom"],"mappings":";;AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;AACA,OAAOC,QAAP,MAAqB,0BAArB;AACA,OAAOC,SAAP,MAAsB,yBAAtB;AACA,OAAOC,GAAP,MAAgB,mBAAhB;AACA,OAAOC,KAAP,MAAkB,qBAAlB;AACA,OAAOC,GAAP,MAAgB,mBAAhB;AACA,OAAQ,kBAAR;AACA,OAAOC,MAAP,MAAmB,qBAAnB;;AACA,SAASC,IAAT,GAAe;AAGX,sBACI;AAAM,IAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AAACC,MAAAA,eAAe,EAAC,MAAjB;AAAwBC,MAAAA,eAAe,EAAC,SAAxC;AAAkDC,MAAAA,KAAK,EAAC;AAAxD,KAAb;AAAA,4BACA;AAAI,MAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AAACC,QAAAA,SAAS,EAAC,QAAX;AAAoBC,QAAAA,QAAQ,EAAC;AAA7B,OAAX;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,YADA,eAEA;AAAI,MAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AAACD,QAAAA,SAAS,EAAC,QAAX;AAAoBE,QAAAA,UAAU,EAAC,OAA/B;AAAuCC,QAAAA,aAAa,EAAC;AAArD,OAAX;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,YAFA,eAGA;AAAK,MAAA,SAAS,EAAC,SAAf;AAAA,6BACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AADA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,YAHA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,UADJ;AAoBH;;KAvBQP,I;AAyBT,eAAeA,IAAf","sourcesContent":["import React from \"react\"\r\nimport Carousel from 'react-bootstrap/Carousel'\r\nimport Aeroplane from './images/aeroplane.jfif'\r\nimport Bus from './images/bus.jfif'\r\nimport Train from './images/train.jfif'\r\nimport Car from './images/car.jfif'\r\nimport  \"./css/styles.css\"\r\nimport Travel from './images/travel.jpg'\r\nfunction Home(){\r\n\r\n\r\n    return(\r\n        <body style={{backgroundImage:\"none\",backgroundColor:\"#182C61\",color:\"#FFFFFF\"}}>\r\n        <h1 style={{textAlign:\"center\",fontSize:\"5rem\"}}>Travel Information Service</h1>\r\n        <h6 style={{textAlign:\"center\",paddingTop:\"10rem\",paddingBottom:\"10rem\"}}>Description Goes Here</h6>\r\n        <div className=\"Homediv\">\r\n        <p>Indian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years.[351] During the Vedic period (c. 1700 – c. 500 BCE), the foundations of Hindu philosophy, mythology, theology and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as dhárma, kárma, yóga, and mokṣa, were established.[62] India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nation's major religions.[352] The predominant religion, Hinduism, has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the Upanishads,[353] the Yoga Sutras, the Bhakti movement,[352] and by Buddhist philosophy.[354]\r\n        Much of Indian architecture, including the Taj Mahal, other works of Mughal architecture, and South Indian architecture, blends ancient local traditions with imported styles.[355] Vernacular architecture is also regional in its flavours.
